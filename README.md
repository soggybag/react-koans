# Welcome to React Koans

These are exercises to learn and practice your React skills.

## Getting Started

Download, fork, or clone this Repo.

Then run:

```javascript
yarn
```

Start the test runner with:

```javascript
yarn test
```

The tests will run in the console and show you the results. The goal is to make each of the tests pass by editing the Components.

All of the Component files are numbered and followed by a name e.g. `06-PetList.js`. The tests are labeled `.test.js` with the same name as the component tested.

The test runner should rerun the tests each time you save.

The tests are ordered by difficulty. You can do them in any order.

## What is a Koan?

  Koans in programming are small lessons on some aspects of a programming language - e.g. syntax, structure, and some common functions and libraries.
  They are usually simple and structured problems where the programmer is asked to fill in the blanks in code to make test cases pass.
